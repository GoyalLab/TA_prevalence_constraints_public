# TA_prevalence_constraints_public

Code for production of all graphical figure panels of Mellis et al., bioRxiv, 2023, "Prevalence of and gene regulatory constraints on transcriptional adaptation in single cells."

To reproduce all panels in Figs. 1 and 5 and respective supplements, first download bulk RNA seq metadata in Table S1 and processed Perturb-seq data as listed in the Methods section.

To reproduce all panels in Figs. 2-4 and respective supplements, first download a copy of the raw simulation data from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JN8P7zWe03uO3oDxoz4RZadKfz8Ar2kX?usp=sharing. Add Functions/ within this repo, and Analysis/simulations/mex_files/ to your MATLAB path.

Prior to running code, edit paths at the top of each script to match your local copy of the data. Scripts for v1.6.5.1 and v1.6.5.3 should be run in the same R session after running scripts for v1.6.5.2.

Feel free to email Yogesh Goyal (yogesh.goyal@northwestern.edu) or Ian Mellis (im2613@cumc.columbia.edu) with any questions.
